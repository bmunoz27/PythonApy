The challenge for this week was to analyze the data and answer a simple question, "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: _"Duh. It gets hotter..."_

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?

The following are three conclusions that I was able to draw from the data in this repository:

1. The figure titled "City Altitude vs Max Temperature" and saved as "TemperatureInWorldCities.png" ilustrates what happens to a city's temperature as their latitude increases. The scatter plot shows that those cities that are close to the equator or zero latitude will have the highest temperature of the other cities. This directly answers our question above. 

2. The second data I wanted to look at was line regression in relation to northern and southern hemispheres. From this dataset I was able to conclude that the southern hemisphere seems to have a positive relation between temperature and latitude. In contrast, the northern hemisphere has a negative relationship. If we look at them closely we can see that as the latitude in the southern hemisphere approaches zero or the equator, the temperature increases. In contrast as the northern hemisphere cities go further from the equater their temperature goes down. 

3. Lastly, I will conclude wind and cloudiness do not seem to have a relation as they get close to the equator. Humidity in the other hand seems to be much lower in the Southern Hemisphere than in the northern hemisohere. But each seems to be around the same relation when it comes to humidity level.
